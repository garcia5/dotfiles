  #
  # This value is used to set the `$TERM` environment variable for
  # each instance of Alacritty. If it is not present, alacritty will

# Shell
#
# You can set `shell.program` to the path of your favorite shell, e.g.

#   - (macOS) /bin/bash --login

#   - (Windows) powershell
shell:

  # If this is `true`, the cursor is temporarily hidden when typing.

# Regex hints
#
# Terminal hints can be used to find text in the visible part of the terminal
# and pipe it to other applications.
hints:
  # Keys used for the hint labels.
  alphabet: "jfkdls;ahgurieowpq"

  # List with all available hints
  #
  # Each hint must have a `regex` and either an `action` or a `command` field.
  # The fields `mouse`, `binding` and `post_processing` are optional.
  #
  # The fields `command`, `binding.key`, `binding.mods`, `binding.mode` and
  # `mouse.mods` accept the same values as they do in the `key_bindings` section.
  #
  # The `mouse.enabled` field controls if the hint should be underlined while
  # the mouse with all `mouse.mods` keys held or the vi mode cursor is above it.
  #
  # If the `post_processing` field is set to `true`, heuristics will be used to
  # shorten the match if there are characters likely not to be part of the hint
  # (e.g. a trailing `.`). This is most useful for URIs.
  #
  # Values for `action`:
  #   - Copy
  #       Copy the hint's text to the clipboard.
  #   - Paste
  #       Paste the hint's text to the terminal or search.
  #   - Select
  #       Select the hint's text.
  #   - MoveViModeCursor
  #       Move the vi mode cursor to the beginning of the hint.

# Mouse bindings
#
# Mouse bindings are specified as a list of objects, much like the key
# bindings further below.
#
# To trigger mouse bindings when an application running within Alacritty
# captures the mouse, the `Shift` modifier is automatically added as a
# requirement.
#
# Each mouse binding will specify a:
#
# - `mouse`:
#
#   - Middle
#   - Left
#   - Right
#   - Numeric identifier such as `5`
#
# - `action` (see key bindings for actions not exclusive to mouse mode)
#
# - Mouse exclusive actions:
#
#   - ExpandSelection
#       Expand the selection to the current mouse cursor location.
#
# And optionally:
#
# - `mods` (see key bindings)
#mouse_bindings:
#  - { mouse: Right,             action: ExpandSelection }
#  - { mouse: Middle, mode: ~Vi, action: PasteSelection  }
